Fault code,Description,Condition,Recovery
m9,Simulated maintenance fault,User has generated a simulated fault.,Reset simulated fault.
m10,Over range,A large concentration has been detected. The Midas requires an independent confirmation that the gas hazard is gone.,Supply known clean air to the Midas and clear this fault.
m11,User calibration expired,The user specified calibration interval has elapsed.,Perform zero and span calibrations. Increase span calibration period.
m12,Cartridge expires soon,Cartridge is old and will expire soon.,Replace the cartridge with a new cartridge.
m13,Flow error,Midas is no longer able to regulate flow (high or low flow condition).,Check filters and pump. Check pressure at inlet and outlet and assure they are within specification.
m14,Interferent present,An interferent is degrading the ability of the Midas to detect gas.,Check application.
m15,Temperature near limit,Temperature within 2 Celsius of limit.,Check installation environment.
m16,Baseline fault,Sensor baseline has drifted.,"Check for background gas concentration, temperature, or humidity fluctuations. Perform zero calibration. Replace cartridge."
m17,Inhibit timeout,Transmitter has been in inhibit mode too long.,Resume monitoring or increase timeout value.
F39,Simulated fault,User has generated a simulated fault.,Reset simulated fault.
F40,Sensor overdosed,Sensor has been exposed to high gas concentrations for long periods.,Replace cartridge.
F41,Baseline fault,Sensor baseline has drifted.,"Check for background gas concentration, temperature, or humidity fluctuations. Perform zero calibration. Replace cartridge."
F42,Calibration expired,Too long since last calibration.,Replace or calibrate the cartridge.
F43,Cartridge expired,Cartridge is too old.,Replace cartridge.
F44,Cell failure,Cartridge has failed Reflex check.,Replace cartridge.
F45,Stabilization timeout,Cartridge has failed to stabilize.,"If temperature or humidity shocks exist, precondition the cartridge. Check for background gas concentration. Replace cartridge."
F46,Cartridge analog failure,Electronic Failure or gas concentration greater than full scale.,Replace cartridge.
F47,Cartridge memory invalid,Checksum error.,Replace cartridge.
F48,Cartridge absent,No communications.,Reseat cartridge. Replace cartridge.
F49,Cartridge wrong type,Cartridge type found to be incorrect after boot-up.,Replace cartridge or press ‘3’ accept if correct.
F80,Temperature limits exceeded,Temperature is outside limits ,Check installation environment.
F81,Flow fail,Flow <70% of nominal for 15 seconds.,Check filters. Check for kinked tubing. Replace pump.
F82,Excessive electrical noise,Internal electronics repeatedly noisy.,Check grounding of Midas chassis. Check termination of cable shields. Relocate the Midas further from noise sources. Add ferrite inductors to cables.
F83,Pyrolyzer fail,Pyrolyzer fails to heat.,Check electrical connection to pyrolyzer. Replace pyrolyzer.
F84,Misc. transmitter fault,Transmitter is defective.,Service or replace Midas.
F86,Coprocessor fail,Coprocessor is damaged.,Contact Honeywell Analytics Service.
F87,Pyrolyzer temp limits exceeded,Pyrolyzer temperature exceeded.,Clean pyrolyzer cooling vents. Contact Honeywell Analytics Service.
F88,Pyrolyzer heater fail,Pyrolyzer heater failed.,Contact Honeywell Analytics Service. Replace the pyrolyzer.
F89,Pyrolyzer power unreg,Target power not achieved within specified time span.,"If 24VDC power, check 21.6 < V < 26.4. Contact Honeywell Analytics Service. Replace pyrolyzer."
F90,Pyrolyzer heater mismatch,Different pyrolyzer type required.,Contact Honeywell Analytics Service.
F91,HTP module required,Check that MIDAS-S-CFX or MIDAS-E-CFX is installed for the high temperature pyrolyzer version.,Change to HT Pyrolyzer.
F92,0P3 pyrolyzer module failure,"0P3 pyrolyzer failed to get up to temperature, 0P3 pyrolyzer flow is out-of-range, or 0P3 pyrolyzer internal failure.",Replace pyrolyzer heater and check flow connections between Midas and 0P3 pyrolyzer.
